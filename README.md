# Graph-Exercise
Implementation of Weighted Graph Data Structure in Python

This script creates a weighted graph object, adds nodes and edges to it, and then finds the shortest path from one district to the other. 
The output of the script is the shortest path and its distance, which are printed to the console.
Here is a screenshot of the output:
-> The shortest path from Ntcheu to Kasungu:
